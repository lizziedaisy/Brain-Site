            <p>
              I'm on holiday in Ireland with my brother in law and the family, and I wake up in hospital after having a huge seizure in my sleep. Referred to epilepsy clinic at home and dismissed.

            <p>
              I am waiting for my epilepsy appointment when I have a huge brain haemorrhage. My left side stops working, and my boyfriend ignores my "I'm sure it's nothing" attitude and takes me to hospital.

              It's not just a bleed: it's a brain tumour. A nice round golf ball, bleeding all over my brain. I start on steroids, which are disgusting. I sleep most of the time.

            I am about to graduate. I sleep all the time, and I can't drink. We have tried more treatments, none of which have worked. Grad ball is crap for me. We're going for plan X.

            <h5>The Surgery - Before</h5>

            <p>
              August 10th at 8am. My surgeon sent me a text yesterday 'back from my holiday, see you tomorrow! All will be fine!'. I'm not sure if it's weird or reassuring. Probably both. My hair is gone. I felt sick. My hair upset me more than surgery. I have zero self confidence and my hair has been my best feature for years. Now it's gone. I look like a Sick Person. Tristan offered to shave his head too, but I think my heart woud break every day looking at him. I'm avoiding mirrors.

            <h5>The Surgery - After</h5>


            <p>
              I woke up. I woke up, and I have toes and fingers that move, and I can see out of my eyes, and I can talk. No feeling will ever top that feeling, for the rest of my life. I get hourly morphine and never sleep because everything is a blur. My nurses are incredible human beings, although my ward is full of grumpy rude old people. I hate old people (sorry, old people).
